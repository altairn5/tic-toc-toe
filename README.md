[https://umdemir.github.io/assignment-t3/](https://umdemir.github.io/assignment-t3/)

## Notes

* Custom board size can be implemented with mixing a neighbour capturing algorithm and Minmax.
        
## Known Issues 
        
* X and O icons are not responsive, and do not scale correctly in very small screens. SVG images should be used 
instead of FontAwesome icons.
